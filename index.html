                    <p>My name is Isaac Fidler. I am 25 years old and I have lived in London for the last 5 years. I am originally from a town called Newbury
                        which is situated just west of Reading, around an hour's journey on the train. I graduated from Goldsmiths University in the summer of
                        last year, where I studied Music Computing. The course was shared between the Music and computing departments so i studied modules such
                        as music in film, as well as learning java and python to a low level. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am a massive music fan. I produce electronic music in my spare time, and I collect records and enjoy DJing when I can. I also love films,
                        books and video games. Aside from music stuff my typical week is filled with gaming, watching films and reading as much as possible.This
                        past year following university I moved into a new shared house, started working at a pizza restaurant in peckham and tried to focus on
                        producing music. As a house, we ran music and art events promoting inclusivity, and trying to build fun, diverse events, in an inclusive space. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Having been gifted so much free time earlier this year after being furloughed, then subsequently let go from work and unable to run events
                        with housemates due to covid restrictions, I made the decision to start looking into programming courses. This is where I started talking to friends,
                        searching for recommendations and eventually finding my way to Founders & Coders.</p>

                    <h2 id="AM">Why I'm Applying</h2>
                    <p> I first heard about Founders and Coders after talking to a friend about getting back into programming after finishing uni and taking a break from computing
                        for almost a year. I went through a sort of educational wind down, taking a break from what I'd been working on the last few years. I’d moved into a new
                        shared house, started a new job and I was focusing on other things with my time. Just before entering the first covid-19 induced lockdown, I was searching
                        for online courses, and material to get back into it. I met with a friend that completed the founders and coders bootcamp last year. After discussing the
                        course with them it became clear that Founders & Coders was the ideal way to get back to it!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I believe I share the belief in the importance of diversity, inclusion and equality that founders & Coders promote. I lived in a rare living situation in a
                        shared house in New Cross for the last 18 months. Where as a house we put on music and arts events where inclusion and diversity sat at the core of everything
                        we did. I admire the push for a more fair and inclusive future that founders and coders are helping to shape and I share the belief that encouraging diversity
                        is incredibly important and necessary to shape diverse experiences and engage with a range of perspectives, and seeing my values reflected by the founders and
                        coders team and the prospect of being able to play a part in helping spread these values is one of the main reason i have applied to this bootcamp.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Peer-led learning is extremely exciting and I see Founders & Coders as proof of why. I am enthusiastic about the access models such as the one founders and coders
                        employ can provide to people. Removing a pay barrier from in front of a successful education system is both joyously fair but also the most effective route to
                        getting the best people for the course, not just the ones that can afford it!. Educational models like this are truly exciting and I would love the chance to
                        experience and benefit from one. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This year, things have felt strange for everyone and at times have been incredibly difficult. I lost my job toward the end of this year due to covid and being
                        able to crack on with the prerequisites and once again engage with computing has been incredibly valuable as a way of keeping me focused and positive the last
                        few months. I’ve enjoyed it immensely and even if my application is not successful, I have enjoyed the work and it has been a faultless reboot to my journey
                        to becoming a developer. </p>
