                    <h2 id="AM">About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Isaac Fidler. I am 25 years old and I have lived in London for the last 5 years. Originally I'm from a town west of
                        London called Newbury. I graduated from Goldsmiths University in the summer of last year, where I studied Music Computing.
                        The course was shared between the Music and computing departments so I studied modules such as music in film, as well as learning
                        Java and Python to a low level. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am a massive music fan. I produce electronic music in my spare time, and I collect records and enjoy DJing when I can.
                         I also love films, books and video games. Aside from music stuff my typical week is filled with gaming, watching films, reading,
                          going for walks and trying to navigate covid restrictions and socialise safely at the moment! This past year following university
                           I moved into a new shared house, started working at a pizza restaurant in Peckham and tried to focus on producing music. As a house,
                           we ran music and art events promoting inclusivity, and trying to build fun, diverse events, in an inclusive space. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Having been given so much free time earlier this year after being furloughed, then subsequently let go from work and unable to
                        run events with housemates due to covid restrictions, I made the decision to start looking into programming courses. This is where
                        I started talking to friends, searching for recommendations and eventually finding my way to Founders & Coders.</p>

                    <h2 id="AM">Why I'm Applying</h2>
                    <p> I first heard about Founders & Coders after talking to a friend about getting back into programming after finishing uni and taking
                        a break from computing for almost a year. I went through a sort of educational wind down, taking a break from what I'd been working
                        on the last few years. I’d moved into a new house, started a new job and I was focusing on other things with my time. Just after
                        entering the first covid-19 induced lockdown, I was searching for online courses, and material to get back into it. I met with a
                        friend that completed the Founders & Coders course last year. After discussing the course with them it became clear that Founders
                        & Coders was the ideal way to get back to it!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I believe I share the same belief in the importance of diversity, inclusion and equality as Founders & Coders. I lived in a rare
                        living situation in a shared house in New Cross for the last 18 months. As a house, we put on music and art events where inclusion
                        and diversity sat at the core of everything we did. I admire the push for a more fair and inclusive future that Founders & Coders
                        are helping to shape and I share the belief that encouraging diversity is incredibly important and necessary to shape diverse experiences
                        and engage with a range of perspectives, and seeing my values reflected by the Founders & Coders team and the prospect of being able
                        to play a part in helping spread these values is one of the main reasons I have applied.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Peer-led learning is extremely exciting and I see Founders & Coders as proof of why. I am enthusiastic about the access models such as
                        the one founders and coders employ can provide to people. Removing a pay barrier from in front of a successful education system is both
                        joyously fair but also the most effective route to getting the best people for the course, not just the ones that can afford it!.
                        Educational models like this are truly exciting and I would love the chance to experience and benefit from one. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This year, things have felt strange for everyone and at times have been incredibly difficult. I lost my job toward the end of this year
                        due to covid and being able to crack on with the prerequisites and once again engage with computing has been incredibly valuable as a
                        way of keeping me focused and positive the last few months. I’ve enjoyed it immensely and even if my application is not successful, I
                        have enjoyed the work and it has been a faultless reboot to my journey to becoming a developer.
